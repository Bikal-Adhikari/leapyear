      <h2>Leap Year Challenge Exercise</h2>
      <p>
        💪This is a Difficult Challenge 💪 Write a program that works out
        whether if a given year is a leap year. A normal year has 365 days, leap
        years have 366, with an extra day in February. The reason why we have
        leap years is really fascinating, this video goes into more detail. This
        is how to work out whether if a particular year is a leap year: A year
        is a leap year if it is evenly divisible by 4 ; except if that year is
        also evenly divisible by 100; unless that year is also evenly divisible
        by 400.
      </p>

      <p>
        e.g. Is the year 2000 a leap year?: 2000 ÷ 4 = 500 (Leap) 2000 ÷ 100 =
        20 (Not Leap) 2000 ÷ 400 = 5 (Leap!)
      </p>

      <p>
        So the year 2000 is a leap year. But the year 2100 is not a leap year
        because: 2100 ÷ 4 = 525 (Leap) 2100 ÷ 100 = 21 (Not Leap) 2100 ÷ 400 =
        5.25 (Not Leap)
      </p>

      <p>
        Warning your output should match the Example Output format exactly, even
        the positions of the commas and full stops. Example Input 1 2400 Example
        Output 1 Leap year. Example Input 2 1989 Example Output 2 Not leap year.
